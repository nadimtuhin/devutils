# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Base64 Encoder/Decoder component to provide a side-by-side interface that supports bidirectional conversion in real-time. Instead of the current stacked layout with mode switching, users will have two text areas side by side - one for plain text and one for Base64 - with automatic conversion happening as they type in either field.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see plain text and Base64 side by side, so that I can easily compare and work with both formats simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN the system SHALL display two text areas side by side
2. WHEN the component loads THEN the left text area SHALL be labeled "Plain Text"
3. WHEN the component loads THEN the right text area SHALL be labeled "Base64"
4. WHEN the viewport is narrow THEN the system SHALL stack the text areas vertically for mobile responsiveness

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic conversion as I type, so that I can see real-time results without clicking a convert button.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the plain text area THEN the system SHALL automatically encode the text to Base64 in the right area
2. WHEN I type in the Base64 area THEN the system SHALL automatically decode the Base64 to plain text in the left area
3. WHEN invalid Base64 is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the plain text area
4. WHEN the conversion is successful THEN the system SHALL clear any previous error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear both fields easily, so that I can start fresh without manually selecting and deleting content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the clear button THEN the system SHALL empty both text areas
2. WHEN I click the clear button THEN the system SHALL clear any error messages
3. WHEN the clear button is clicked THEN the system SHALL focus on the plain text area

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy the converted content easily, so that I can use it in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the copy button next to the plain text area THEN the system SHALL copy the plain text to clipboard
2. WHEN I click the copy button next to the Base64 area THEN the system SHALL copy the Base64 text to clipboard
3. WHEN content is successfully copied THEN the system SHALL show a brief success indicator
4. WHEN copy fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback for errors, so that I understand when my input is invalid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid Base64 is detected THEN the system SHALL highlight the Base64 text area with a red border
2. WHEN invalid Base64 is detected THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid Base64" in the plain text area
3. WHEN valid input is provided THEN the system SHALL remove error styling and messages
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL not crash or become unresponsive
