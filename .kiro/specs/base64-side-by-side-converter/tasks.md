# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create utility functions for Base64 conversion with error handling
  - Implement safe encoding function that handles UTF-8 characters
  - Implement safe decoding function with proper error catching
  - Create debounced conversion hook for performance optimization
  - Write unit tests for all conversion utilities
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 2. Build reusable TextAreaWithCopy component
  - Create component that combines textarea with integrated copy button
  - Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality with fallback support
  - Add visual feedback for successful/failed copy operations
  - Write unit tests for copy functionality and user interactions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement main state management and conversion logic
  - Set up comprehensive state structure for plain text, Base64, and errors
  - Create useEffect hooks for bidirectional real-time conversion
  - Implement logic to track which field was last modified to prevent conversion loops
  - Write unit tests for state management and conversion triggering
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 5.3_

- [ ] 4. Create side-by-side layout with responsive design
  - Implement CSS Grid/Flexbox layout for side-by-side text areas
  - Add responsive breakpoints for mobile stacking
  - Style text areas with proper labels and spacing
  - Write tests for responsive layout behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement error handling and visual feedback
  - Add error state management for invalid Base64 input
  - Create visual error indicators (red borders, error messages)
  - Implement automatic error clearing when valid input is provided
  - Write tests for error display and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Add clear functionality and focus management
  - Implement clear all button that resets both text areas
  - Add proper focus management after clear operation
  - Ensure error states are cleared when clearing fields
  - Write tests for clear functionality and focus behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Replace existing Base64Encoder component with new implementation
  - Update the existing component file with the new side-by-side implementation
  - Ensure the component maintains the same export structure
  - Verify the component integrates properly with the existing app structure
  - Test the updated component in the full application context
  - _Requirements: All requirements integrated_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive integration tests
  - Write tests for complete user workflows (typing in either field)
  - Test error scenarios and recovery paths
  - Add accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers
  - Test copy functionality across different browsers/environments
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
