# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing project from npm package manager to pnpm (performant npm). The migration will improve installation speed, reduce disk space usage through hard linking, and provide better dependency management while maintaining all existing functionality and development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm instead of npm for package management, so that I can benefit from faster installations and reduced disk space usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN pnpm SHALL be used for all package management operations
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN pnpm SHALL create a pnpm-lock.yaml file instead of package-lock.json
3. WHEN running scripts THEN pnpm SHALL execute all package.json scripts correctly
4. WHEN installing new packages THEN pnpm SHALL manage dependencies with proper hoisting and deduplication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing npm scripts to work with pnpm, so that my development workflow remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running build commands THEN pnpm SHALL execute the build process successfully
2. WHEN running test commands THEN pnpm SHALL execute all tests successfully
3. WHEN running development server THEN pnpm SHALL start the dev server correctly
4. WHEN running linting commands THEN pnpm SHALL execute ESLint successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration files for pnpm, so that the package manager behaves optimally for this project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pnpm is configured THEN the system SHALL have appropriate .npmrc or pnpm configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN pnpm SHALL handle peer dependencies correctly
3. WHEN workspaces are needed THEN pnpm SHALL support workspace configuration
4. WHEN hoisting is required THEN pnpm SHALL configure appropriate hoisting settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation updated to reflect pnpm usage, so that other contributors know how to work with the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README is updated THEN it SHALL contain pnpm installation and usage instructions
2. WHEN package.json is updated THEN it SHALL include pnpm-specific configurations if needed
3. WHEN CI/CD exists THEN documentation SHALL reflect any necessary changes for pnpm
4. WHEN development setup is documented THEN it SHALL use pnpm commands instead of npm

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be clean and complete, so that no npm artifacts remain that could cause conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN package-lock.json SHALL be removed
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN node_modules SHALL be regenerated with pnpm
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN .gitignore SHALL be updated to include pnpm-lock.yaml
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN no npm-specific configurations SHALL remain that conflict with pnpm
